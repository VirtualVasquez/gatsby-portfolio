I started to learn to code in 2018, and since then I have never looked backed. Coding hit a perfect trifecta that I was always looking for in a career.

It allows me to help people in many different ways.
It grants me the ability to bring cool and creative concepts to life.
It pushes me to constantly go beyond my limits, both professionally and personally.

I get excited at the opportunities to face new challenges, and that translates into making sure that anything I'm involved in receives nothing less than the best of me.

As a full-stack developer, I get to work in virtually anything and everything that I want and you need. Whether that's creating user-friendly experiences with React and Bootstrap, setting up servers with .NET or Node.js, or constructing and connecting to databases with SQL or MongoDB, I take it all in stride and with a smile.
